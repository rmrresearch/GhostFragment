/** @brief Code factorization for implementing a view of an object
 *
 *  Views allow us to alias the state of an object and "view" it as if it had a
 *  specific API. The view encapsulates the conversion logic. In LibChemist we
 *  rely on the PIMPL idiom to decouple the API from the state/implementation. A
 *  natural way to encapsulate the conversion logic is to use different PIMPLs
 *  for owning vs. aliasing. Say we have a class `A` that is implemented in
 *  terms of an abstract base class `Base` and that we have two PIMPLs `Own` and
 *  `Alias`, which derive from `Base` such that `Own` implements `A` using
 *  memory it owns and `Alias` implements `A` using memory it aliases. Since `A`
 *  ultimately stores the `Own` or `Alias` instance via the common base class
 *  `Base`, the user has no way of knowing whether `A` owns or aliases its
 *  memory. This can lead to nasty side effects where an aliased object is
 *  accidentally modified when the user intents to only modify the `A` instance.
 *
 *  The ViewBase class represents code factorization for implementing a view by
 *  wrapping an aliasing instance. The use of separate class (as opposed to say
 *  templating `A` above on `Own` vs `Alias`) allows us to easily change the
 *  behavior of the view vs. the object. In particular the object `A` should
 *  have value semantics regardless of whether it aliases or owns its state
 *  (i.e. copying `A` should *always* result in a deep copy). On the other hand
 *  views are akin to other aliasing types such as iterators, pointers, or
 *  references so copying should be shallow. While it is possible to do this
 *  with template specialization and/or meta-template programming, maintaining
 *  two class hierarchies is ultimately easier to maintain.
 *
 *  Usage: Derive from this class and call `pimpl()` to get the instance that
 *         contains the aliased data. This class will automatically take care of
 *         const-correctness for your dervied class, so just use the result of
 *         the `pimpl()` function as is.
 *
 *  As a design note, the instance of `A` that aliases the data is owned by
 *  this class so as to facilitate shallow copying `ViewBase` instances without
 *  needing to know more about the API of `A` (in particular this allows `A` to
 *  use its copy ctor for deep copies).
 *
 * @tparam is_const In order to ensure we get the const-correctness of the view
 *                  right we need to know if the view should be read-only. The
 *                  @p is_const template non-type parameter should be set to
 *                  `true` if the resulting view is read-only and `false`
 *                  otherwise.
 *
 * @tparam AliasedType The class `A` in the description above. It is the type of
 *                     the class that holds the aliasing PIMPL. We ultimately
 *                     assume that @p AliasedType is moveable and can be
 *                     compared via `operator==`. @p AliasedType should be an
 *                     unqualified type.
