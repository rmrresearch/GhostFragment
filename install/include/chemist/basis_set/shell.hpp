/** @brief Models a set of AOs with a common center, total angular momentum, and
 *         CGTOs.
 *
 *  Each Cartesian AO is made up of the product of a CGTO and a term of the
 *  form: @f$x^ay^bz^c@f$ such that @f$a+b+c = \ell@f$ (with @f$\ell@f$ being
 *  the total angular momentum of the AO. Spherical AOs are then formed by
 *  taking linear combinations of Cartesian AOs (the coefficients of the
 *  transformation being given by the spherical transform). Histroically, in
 *  electronic structure theory we implicitly store much of this information in
 *  what is called a shell. A shell is comprised of a CGTO, @f$\ell@f$, and
 *  whether the AOs in the shell are Cartesian or spherical (often called pure).
 *  All other information is stored implicitly. This class adheres to this
 *  convention.
 *
 *  @tparam T The type used to store parameters associated with the CGTO.
 *            Expected to be a non-cv qualified POD floating-point type such as
 *            `double` or `float`.
