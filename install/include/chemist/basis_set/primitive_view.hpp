/** @brief Models a Gaussian Primitive by reference.
 *
 *  This class is used to model a Gaussian Primitive by reference. For our
 *  purposes a Gaussian Primitive is a function @f$g(\vec{r};c, \alpha)@f$ such
 *  that:
 *
 *  @f{
 *  g(\vec{r}; c, \alpha) = c e^{-\alpha r^2},
 *  @f}
 *
 *  where @f$c@f$ is the coefficient or weight of the Gaussian (usually in a
 *  linear combination, but could also be a normalization factor), @f$\alpha@f$
 *  is the exponent, and @f$\vec{r}@f$ is the point in Cartesian space that the
 *  Gaussian is centered on.
 *
 * @tparam T The type used to hold the parameters of the Primitive and the
 *         coordinates of the center. Assumed to be a floating-point POD type.
