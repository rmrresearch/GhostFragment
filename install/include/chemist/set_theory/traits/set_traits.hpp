/** @brief Defines the interface that the Subset and FamilyOfSets classes use
 *         to interface with the parent object.
 *
 *  The primary template assumes that the parent object has publically
 *  accessible:
 *  - type `size_type` defining the type the object uses for offsets and
 *    indexing.
 *  - type `value_type` defining the type of the elements in the object
 *  - member `size()` which can be used to retrieve the number of elements in
 *    the object.
 *  - member `operator[](size_type)` which can be used to retrieve the an
 *    element of the object by offset
 *  - type `value_type` is comparable via `operator==`.
 *
 *  If any of the above is not true then using an object of type `SetType`
 *  with the Subset/FamilyOfSets classes requires specializing `SetTraits` for
 *  type `SetType`.
 *
 *  @tparam SetType The type of the object being subset-ed. To use the primary
 *                  template definiton @p SetType must satisfy the criteria
 *                  listed in the description. Otherwise use of FamilyOfSets and
 *                  Subset with @p SetType requires specializing SetTraits.
