/** @brief An object that is associated with a point in 3-D Cartesian space.
 *
 *  See
 * https://nwchemex-project.github.io/Chemist/developer/design/molecule.html for
 * design.
 *
 *  Conceptually a point is nothing more than three floating point values, which
 *  respectively indicate its Cartesian `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates. By
 *  convention these coordinates can also be thought of respectively as the
 *  0-th, 1-st, and 2-nd components of a three-dimensional vector. The API of
 *  the Point class allows for both views by aliasing `x()`, `y()` and `z()` to
 *  `coord(0)`, `coord(1)`, and `coord(2)` respectively.
 *
 *  @note The implementation of this class is contained in point.cpp. Thus to
 *        use this class with a new type one needs to add an explicit template
 *        instantiation for that type to point.cpp (and declare it in this
 *        file).
 *
 * @tparam T The type used to store each Cartesian coordinate. Assumed to be a
 *         POD type like double or float.
