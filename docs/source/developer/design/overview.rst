GhostFragment Design Overview
#############################

The purpose of this page is to provide a high-level overview of the design of
GhostFragment.

**********************
What is GhostFragment?
**********************

GhostFragment is a software package designed to facilitate developing and
running fragment-based methods. It is now known that to use fragment-based
methods to accurately approximate traditional methods one must also account
for basis-set superposition error. GhostFragment also includes functionality to
correct for basis-set superposition error.

*****************************
Why do we need GhostFragment?
*****************************

There is no one-stop shop for fragment-based methods. Various electronic
structure packages have implementations of one or a few methods, but no
package readily provides acccess to a large number of methods. GhostFragment
seeks to change this.
