Difference between fragments and n-mers?
########################################

- Atoms in fragments are usually spatially close together
- Distinction matters for BSSE?

Consider four disjoint fragments I, J, K, and L. Say we find that IJK and 
JKL are the only trimers which survive screening. If we treat IJK and JKL as
ovelapping fragments, the GMBE suggests: IJK + JKL - JK; however a traditional
MBE gives I + J + K + L, IJ - I - J...
