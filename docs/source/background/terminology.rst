There are a lot of existing fragment-based methods. Many of these methods have
coined their own terms for similar concepts. In order to provide a unified
description of these methods we have settled on the following terminology.

fragment
   The inputs to the MBE and GMBE. Fragments are sets of groups (which 
   themselves are sets of atoms).

group
   A set of atoms which appear together in every |n|-mer. Groups can be as small
   as a single atom and as large as the user wants.
