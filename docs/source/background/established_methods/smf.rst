Systematic Molecular Fragmentation
##################################

SMF was introduced by :cite:t:`Deev2005` as a generalization of MFCC. At its 
core, SMF introduces a fragmentation method, and a capping method. Initial
applications focused on hydrocarbons, using a relatively wide assortment of 
levels of theory. Absolute energies, energy barriers, bond-lengths, bond angles,
and vibrational frequencies were computed and compared to the supersystem 
counterparts.

In a follow-up paper :cite:t:`Collins2006` presented the original SMF Algorithm
in more detail. New this time were the ring-repair rule and an approximate
treatment of the non-bonded interactions between distant fragments. To test the
new SMF algorithm structures were taken from the Cambridge Structural Database.
