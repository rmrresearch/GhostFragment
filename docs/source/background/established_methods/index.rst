Established Fragment Based Methods
##################################

Over the years a lot of fragment-based methods have been proposed. In many cases
these methods are discussed as if they are black-box methods akin to say SCF or
MP2. It is our view that each fragment-based method can be thought of as being
comprised of four pieces: a fragmentation method, a capping method, an embedding
method, and a screening method. This section reviews the literature and 
explicitly decomposes the existing methods into these four pieces. In practice, 
we find that subject to this view, most existing fragment-based methods are not
well defined black-box methods as has been portayed, but rather are better 
characterized as families of methods. 

As a disclaimer, these sections are unlikely to be exahustive; particularly for 
the more popular methods.
