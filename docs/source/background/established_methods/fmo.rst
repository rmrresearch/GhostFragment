Fragment Molecular Orbital Method
#################################

The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method is arguably one of the most 
established methods in the field of fragment-based methods.

Origins
=======

.. |I| replace:: :math:`I`
.. |IJ| replace:: :math:`IJ`

The FMO method arguably got its start as the pair interaction molecular orbital
(PIMO) method :cite:t:`Kitaura1999a`. In the original paper, for a system split 
into :math:`N` disjoint fragments, the Hamiltonian for the |I|-th fragment 
is written as:

.. math::
   \widehat{H}_I = \widehat{H}_I^0 + \sum_{J=1; J\neq I}^N\widehat{V}^I_{J}

where :math:`\widehat{H}_I^0` is the Hamiltonian of the |I|-th fragment 
and :math:`\widehat{V}^I_{J}` is the interaction of |I| with :math:`J`. 
:math:`\widehat{V}_{IJ}` is given by :ref:`Density Embedding`. The PIMO method
considers up to two-body terms, with the Hamiltonian of dimer |IJ| given
by:

.. math::
   \widehat{H}_{IJ} = \widehat{H}_{IJ}^0 + 
                      \sum_{K=1; K\neq J\neq I}^N\widehat{V}^{IJ}_{K}

Analogous to the monomer Hamiltonians, :math:`\widehat{H}_{IJ}^0` is the 
Hamiltonian of the |IJ|-th dimer and :math:`\widehat{V}^{IJ}_{K}` is the 
interaction of dimer |IJ| with fragment :math:`K`. Fragment densities are
converged at the one-body level and used as is in two-body terms.

Initial applications of PIMO looked at interaction energies of water trimers and 
tetramers. At the HF/6-31G** level of theory PIMO differed from supersystem
interactions by about 0.1 kcal/mol.

That same year, FMO proper was introduced :cite:t:`Kitaura1999`. Physically the
equations of FMO are the same as PIMO. The difference between FMO and PIMO is
conceptual and has to do with the fragment orbitals. In PIMO each fragment was a
closed-shell molecule, and the intial guess orbitals are simply obtained by
running the isolated closed-shell molecule. In FMO, the initial orbitals for
fragment |I| are generated by:

- creating a reference system for fragment |I|,
- localizing the orbitals of the reference system to the atoms in |I|,
- discarding contributions to the orbitals from atoms outside of |I|, and then
- renormalizing the orbitals.

Exactly how to form the "reference system" is vague in the initial study.
