EC-MFCC was introduced by :cite:t:`Li_2005` as a follow-up to the :ref:`DCLC`
fragment-based method. EC-MFCC differs from DCLC in that it also inclues 
two-body interactions. The higher-body interactions are computed 
among the pseudoatoms not the fragments (our terminology; the original 
manuscript refers to them as fragments) and rely on the |mfcc_screen|
method to avoid computing negligible two-body interactions. 

At the one-body level EC-MFCC is the same as DCLC. Since it uses essentially two
fragmentation methods, from our perspective, EC-MFCC is a multi-layer fragment-
based method. The first layer is a traditional MBE using pseudoatoms as 
fragments  and the :ref:`DCLC_capping_method`. The second layer is the DCLC 
calculation. Hence the energy for the two-body EC-MFCC method is given by:

.. math::

   E \approx& \left(\sum_{I} E_I +\sum_{I<J}\Delta E_{IJ}\right) +
       \left(E^{DCLC} - \sum_{I}E_I\right)\\
     \approx& E^{DCLC} + \sum_{I<J}\Delta E_{IJ}

where summation indices are pseudoatoms and :math:`E^{DCLC}` is the energy of
the fragments computed using a 1-body GMBE (fragments/pseudoatoms again
adhereing to our terminology). EC-MFCC was applied to a series of medium to 
large systems. Energies and geometries were computed with EC-MFCC and compared 
to small basis MP2 supersystem results.
