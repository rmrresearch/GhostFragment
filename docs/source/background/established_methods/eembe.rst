The EE-MBE method was proposed by :cite:t:`Dahlke2006`. Its initial formulation
essentially amounts to two embedding method, |q_a| and |q_b|. introduction
amounted to using the MBE with one of two embedding methods dubbed 
:ref:`EE-MBE-A` and :ref:`EE-MBE-B` (fragments were molecules, no caps were
needed, and no screening occurred). This initial study was largely dedicated to
understanding how these two embedding methods work on small water clusters (up
to a pentamer). Notably errors in the absolute energy only weakly depended on 
the charge scheme used (Mulliken, TIP3P, and CM4 were considered), and whether
:ref:`EE-MBE-A` or :ref:`EE-MBE-B` was used.
