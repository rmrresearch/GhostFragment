Molecular Fractionation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC)
**************************************************

Introduced in 2003 MFCC :cite:t:`Zhang2003` focused on fragment-based 
calculations of proteins. Using our terminology, the original method treated
individual amino acids as groups, and capped the alpha carbon of the peptide 
bond with NH2 caps and the nitrogen atom with a -RCH2 group (R being the side
chain of the amino acid the cap is replacing). The resulting fragments intersect
with fragments they are bonded to. MFCC pairs the intersections together as a
molecule (instead of treating the intersections individually). Initial small 
basis SCF and DFT (with the B3LYP functional) results focused on water-peptide 
interactions and were shown to be in excellent agreement with supersystem 
results.
