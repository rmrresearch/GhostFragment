Algorithms for Fragment-Based Methods
#####################################

In practice many of the fragment-based methods in the field use algorithms with
common sub-algorithms. For example, at one point or another all such methods
must define a set of fragments. Our intent here is to allow the user to mix-and-
match sub-algorithms as they see fit. For that reason, the presentations of the
algorithms in this section are more generalized than many of the original
manuscripts. As part of :ref:`established_fragment_based_methods`, we provide
context on how to recover the original methods, as faithfully as GhostFragment 
allows.
