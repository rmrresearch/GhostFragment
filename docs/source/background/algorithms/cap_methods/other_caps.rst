Dummy Group

.. note::

   :cite:t:`Ranganathan1997` does not call this method the "dummy group"
   method, but in referring to :cite:`Ranganathan1997`, :cite:t:`Liu2014`
   do so (I make no claim that :cite:t:`Liu2014` coined the term either).

In the context of QM/MM method development, :cite:t:`Ranganathan1997` noted 
that one usually breaks carbon-carbon bonds between :math:`sp^3` hybridized
carbons. Letting |X| be the carbon which is in the fragment, and |Y| be the
carbon not in the fragment, the dummy-group approach replaces |Y| not with a
single hydrogen atom, but with a methyl group. While not explicitly considered
in :cite:t:`Ranganathan1997`, the presumed generalization is that |Y| is
replaced by the monovalent functional group :math:`YH_{n-1}` where :math:`n` is
the valency of |Y| in the supersystem.
