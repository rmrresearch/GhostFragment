H Capping

.. |X| replace:: :math:`X`
.. |Y| replace:: :math:`Y`
.. |F| replace:: :math:`F`

The simplest possible capping scheme. When a bond between an atom |X| and an
atom |Y| is severed such that |X| is in the fragment |F|, but |Y| is not. This 
capping scheme adds a hydrogen atom to |F| at the location of |Y|.
