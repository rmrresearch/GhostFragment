  comment   = {- Review of the PBC variant of GEBF
- Describes the GEBF14 variant of the method
- Notes that the compensation field is a unique contribution not found in other methods.
- Also says the fact that PBC-GEBF can be applied to large molecules (by fragmenting the large molecules too) is  a unique aspect, though it's not clear how unique that really is.
- Includes a comparison of PBC-GEBF-M062X/6-31g(d,p) gradients to supersystem results for ammonia crystals (geometries taken from the optimization path). Energy differences are less than 2.1 mH, gradients "at all atoms" (not sure exactly what that means) 0.40 mH/Bohr. Lattice parameters differ by less than 1%.
- Also evaluate lattice energies for optimized ammonia crystal (optimized using PBC-GEBF-MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p).with several DFT and wavefunction methods (aug-cc-pVTZ basis with BSSE corrections) compared to experiment. MP2-F12 and CCSD(T)-F12 match to within 1 kcal/mol.
- Also compute frequency shifts in vibrational spectra of BH3NH3 with PBC-GEBF (MP2, M06-2X, and PBE-D) with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. MP2 matches experiment better (error is about 20 wavenumbers for MP2)
- Methacrylamide polymorhps optimized using PBC-GEBF-M062X/6-311++G(d,p), deviates less than 2% from experiment. Also computed Raman spectra; compared to experiment reasonable agreement.
- PBC-GEBF (MP2, M06-2X, and X3LYP)/ 6-311++G(d,p) is applied to crystalized ionic liquids.Optimized geometries are compared to experiment and match well. Also compute Raman spectra},

  comment   = {- Looks at NMR shifts using GEBF14 method
- Point out that if one wants shift of specific atoms, only need derivatives of fragments containing those atoms.
- Calibration first looks at a Trp-cage mini protein. Errors relative to supersystem results for HF/pcSseg-2, CAM-B3LYP/pcSSeg-2, and M06-2X/pcSSeg-2. GEBF is able to accuratlely approximate shielding constants for most atoms, though it does exhibit large errors for oxygen.
- Additional calibration is for a CH3CN solvated in CHCl3 using B97-2/pcSseg-2. So long as the ultrafine grid is used the GEBF shielding constants matach well.
- Note that Beran previously saw integration grid fine-ness have an issue on NMR constants
- Next look at an oligoamide $\beta$-sheet. Optimized the structure with GEBF-B97-2/pcSseg-2. NMR shifts comptued at the same level. Shifts are compared to experiment and match well in most cases.
- The next system is a supramolecular aggregate. Also optimized at GEBF-B97-2/6-31G(d,p). NMR shifts computed with the pcSseg-2 basis though. Compared to experiment again, deviations are all small.
- Return to the CH3CN solvated in CHCl3, this time for an ensemble average of 200 clusters.Gas-to-solution shift is converged after considering 120 clusters. Results from QM/MM MD match experiment much better than results from classical MD, though the error is still a bit large (2 to 4 ppm)},
