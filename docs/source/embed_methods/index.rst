Embedding Algorithms

By breaking the system into fragments we neglect interactions among the 
fragments. We can build these interactions back in  by considering higher-order 
truncations of the (G)MBE. Alternatively, we can *ad hoc* try to account for the 
missing interactions. This is where embedding methods come in. Embedding methods
"embed" the fragment (or in general :math:`n`-mer) in a low-level description of
the rest of the system.
