Davidson and Chakravorty :cite:t:`Davidson_1995`:

- Two definitions of BSSE:

  - Error in caclculated dimerzation energy
  - Difference between calculated dimerzation energy and true interaction energy
    for basis employed

    - No agreement on "true interaction energy"

- Points out CP can be written as a correction to monomer energies or decrease
  of dimer energy.
- Interesting thought experiment about equating CP and BSSE
- New definition of BSSE in terms of the orthogonal complement
- Presents sample calculations of this new definition of BSSE for H2 and H2O
