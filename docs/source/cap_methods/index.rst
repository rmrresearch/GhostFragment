Capping Methods
###############

When fragmenting large covalently-bonded molecules one must necessarily sever
covalent bonds (*i.e.*, assign covalently bonded atoms to different fragments).
Splitting the bonding pair of electrons evenly among the fragments leads to
large perturbations in the electronic structure (*i.e.*, radicals). Capping
methods mitigate this by providing a surrogate for the target system's 
electronic environment.
