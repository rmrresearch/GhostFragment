:cite:t:`Deev2005` introduced a means of fragmenting large covalently bonded
molecules. As originally presented, the SMF fragmentation method was used to
define the fragments, intersections, and energy expansion coefficients. The
procedure is parameterized by a non-zero integer |l| and is refered to as a 
level |l| procedure. Using our terminology the level |l| procedure is:

#. Assign pseudoatoms
#. Establish connectivity, the result is the graph |G0|
#. Find the pseudoatom in |G0| which has the highest degree and that is at least
   |l| edges away from two different pseudoatoms. Define this pseudoatom as 
   |A0|. If no such pseudoatom exists, then |G0| is a fragment and not
   considered further.
#. Let |Bi| be the set of pseduoatoms which are |i| edges away from |A0|. 
   Starting from |B1| select the two pseudoatoms of highest degree. Let these
   pseudoatoms be |A1| and |A1p|.
#. From |B2| select the pseudoatom which has the hightest degree and is
   bonded to |A1|. This is atom |A2|. Similarly, from |B2| select the pseudoatom
   which has the highest degree and is bonded to |A1p|. This is atom |A2p|.
#. Repeat the above for pseudoatoms in |B3| through |Bl1|.
#. Finally from |Bl| select the pseudoatom with the **lowest** degree that is
   bonded to pseudo atom |Al1|; this is atom |Al|. Similarly, |Alp| is the 
   pseudoatom in |Bl| that is bonded to pseudoatom |Al1p|. The result is a 
   path of 2|l| edges that is centered on |A0|.
#. Break the |Al1|-|Al| bond. The resulting graphs are |G1| and |G2|.
#. Break the |Al1p| - |Alp| bond. The resulting graphs are |G3| and |G4|.
#. Break both the |Al1|-|Al| and |Al1p|-|Alp| bonds. The resulting graphs are
   |G5|, |G6|, and |G7|.
#. Let |G| be the set of graphs which is in either the set "|G1|, |G2|, |G3|, 
   |G4|" or the set "|G5|, |G6|, |G7|" (*i.e.* ignore graphs which appear in
   both sets), repeat steps 3-11 for each graph in |G|
#. The previous step terminates when none of the graphs generated in step 11 
   survive step 3 of the next cycle. The resulting set of fragments is |F|.

The original presentation contains a few other details we have omitted, namely:

- How to calculate the coefficients of the fragments; we instead opt to use the
  IEP
- Restrictions on what size rings can be broken for a given |l|. The motivation
  for these rules stems from their capping method choice. To be more general we
  instead adopt the view that if a ring shouldn't be broken, it should be 
  protected as a pseudoatom.
- An ad hoc means of adding in some non-bonding interactions by considering
  dimers. We prefer the traditional union-approach as it is more systematic.
