SMF Screening 05
****************

SMF as introduced by :cite:t:`Deev2005` can be thought of as a one-body GMBE.
In turn, there are interactions which are neglected by this expansion. Letting
|F| be the set of fragments used for the one-body expansion. "cite:t:`Deev2005`
suggest creating an auxiliary set of fragments |Fp|, such that if |Fi| and |Fj| 
are disjoint fragments in |Fp|, then their union, |fij|, must not appear in any 
fragment in |F|. Given such an |Fp|, then subtracting the energies of |Fi| and 
|Fj| from the energy of |fij| yields a two-body correction. 

In their arcticle :cite:t:`Deev2005` specifically stated that |Fp| should be
created by editing the fragments which result from a level one 
:ref:`SMF Fragmentation 05` fragmentation method. The editing process is what
ensures the fragments in |Fp| are disjoint and that their union does not appear
in |F|. The exact editing process appears to be somewhat ad hoc.
