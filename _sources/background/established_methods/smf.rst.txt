Systematic Molecular Fragmentation
##################################

SMF was introduced by :cite:t:`Deev2005` as a generalization of MFCC. At its 
core, SMF introduces a fragmentation method, and a capping method. Initial
applications focused on hydrocarbons, using a relatively wide assortment of 
levels of theory. Absolute energies, energy barriers, bond-lengths, bond anbles,
and vibrational frequencies were computed and compared to the supersystem 
counterparts.
