Electorstatically-Embedded Many-Body Expansion (EE-MBE)
#######################################################

The EE-MBE method was proposed by :cite:t:`Dahlke2006`. Its initial introduction
amounted to using the MBE with one of two embedding methods dubbed 
:ref:`EE-MBE-A` and :ref:`EE-MBE-B`. This initial study was largely dedicated to
understanding how these two embedding methods work on small water clusters (up
to a pentamer). Notably errors in the absolute energy only weakly depended on 
the charge scheme used (Mulliken, TIP3P, and CM4 were considered), and whether
:ref:`EE-MBE-A` or :ref:`EE-MBE-B` was used.
