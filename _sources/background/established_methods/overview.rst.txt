Overview of Established Fragment Based Methods
##############################################

TODO: Proper overview instead of bullet points

- Many fragment-based methods started in relative isolation
- Each group called their method something different
- Even when similarities emerge, typically the gropu maintains the method's name
- Tendency to talk about methods as if they're black box
- Our argument is that each method can be decomposed into a few key algorithms
- Specifying the algorithms is akin to specifying a method.
