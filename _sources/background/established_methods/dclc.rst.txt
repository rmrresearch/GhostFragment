Divide and Conquer Local Correlation (DCLC)
###########################################

DCLC was developed by :cite:t:`Li2004` as an extension of the :ref:`MFCC` method 
to beyond protein-molecule interactions. The DCLC method uses the 
:ref:`DCLC_fragmentation_method` combined with the :ref:`DCLC_capping_method`.
They propose using the mean deviation of Mulliken charges as a metric for
assessing the fragment quality. Initial applications focused only on replicating
the supersystem correlation energy.
