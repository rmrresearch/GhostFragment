Theoretical Background
######################

The pages in this part attempt to provide a comprehensive theoretical background
to the topics of basis-set superposition error and fragment-based methods.

.. warning::

   This is a work in progress. The list of fragment-based methods is incomplete.
   Furthermore algorithm names are preliminary and may change as the literature
   is summarized (our intent is to name algorithms after their first
   occurrence).
