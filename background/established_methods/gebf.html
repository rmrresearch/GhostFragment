<p>GEBF is the culmanation of the <a class="reference internal" href="dclc.html#dclc"><span class="std std-ref">Divide and Conquer Local Correlation (DCLC)</span></a> methods.</p>
<p>Development of GEBF was motivated by a need to treat large
macromolecules/clusters that are charged or highly polar <span id="id1"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id67" title="Wei Li, Shuhua Li, and Yuansheng Jiang. Generalized energy-based fragmentation approach for computing the ground-state energies and properties of large molecules. The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 111(11):2193–2199, 2007.">59</a></sup></span>. The
original GEBF method, which we term the GEBF07 method, consists of the <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf07-fragmentation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF07 Fragmentation Method</span></a>,
with <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/cap_methods/h_capping.html#standard-distance-capping"><span class="std std-ref">Standard Distance</span></a> capping, a slight variation of <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/screening_methods/distance.html#smf06-screening"><span class="std std-ref">SMF06 Screening</span></a>, and an <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/embed_methods/point_charge.html#iterative-point-charge-embedding"><span class="std std-ref">Iterative Point Charge Embedding</span></a>. GEBF’s
original presentation also includes an energy equation which is simply a one-
body GMBE corrected for the
self-interaction of the point charges (<em>i.e.</em>, it is assumed that the energies
of the fragments include not only the interaction of the fragment with the point
charges, but also the interactions among the point charges). Initial
applications of GEBF focused on peptides and water clusters with the HF and MP2
methods. In addition to absolute energies this study also considered dipole
moments and static polarizabilities.</p>
<p><span id="id2">Hua <em>et al.</em><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id68" title="Weijie Hua, Tao Fang, Wei Li, Jian-Guo Yu, and Shuhua Li. Geometry optimizations and vibrational spectra of large molecules from a generalized energy-based fragmentation approach. The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 112(43):10864–10872, 2008.">33</a></sup></span> introduced the GEBF08 method which differs from the GEBF07
method in nearly all regards. In particular GEBF08 uses the <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf08-fragmentation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF08 Fragmentation Method</span></a>
fragmentation method, <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/embed_methods/point_charge.html#iterative-point-charge-embedding"><span class="std std-ref">Iterative Point Charge Embedding</span></a> (I assume since the GEBF07 method is cited, but
the article is not clear on this point), <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/cap_methods/h_capping.html#standard-distance-capping"><span class="std std-ref">Standard Distance</span></a> capping, and no (?) screening.
GEBF08 was applied to geometry optimizations and
vibrational frequency calculations. The GEBF08 energies, optimized geometries,
and vibrational frequencies were compared to the conventional results. Small
basis SCF (both HF and DFT) results, for several types of systems (clusters,
peptides, and hydrogelators) are presented.</p>
<p>The next methodologic development came when <span id="id3">Hua <em>et al.</em><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id72" title="Shugui Hua, Weijie Hua, and Shuhua Li. An efficient implementation of the generalized energy-based fragmentation approach for general large molecules. The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 114(31):8126–8134, July 2010. doi:10.1021/jp103074f.">30</a></sup></span> updated the
fragmentation method of the GEBF08 method. The resulting GEBF10 method uses the
<a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf10-fragmentation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF10 Fragmentation Method</span></a> fragmentation method which is similar to the original <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf07-fragmentation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF07 Fragmentation Method</span></a> method
with a series of “extension rules”. GEBF10 was applied to a series of large
organic molecules. Computed properties included absolute energies, relative
energies, and optimized geometries all with small basis HF or DFT. Compared to
the supersystem results GEB10 did well for geometries, but the errors in the
energetics were often off by more than 1 kcal/mol.</p>

extends <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf10-fragmentation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF10 Fragmentation Method</span></a> by augmenting the original set of fragments with additional
fragments formed from pairs of pseudoatoms (plus the pseudoatoms near that
pair). The resulting GEBF12 method was then applied to several peptides and
large molecules. GEBF12 performed better than GEBF10 (for example for binding
energies of the large molecules GEBF10 erred from supersystem results by about
3.8 kcal/mol whereas GEBF10 only erred by about 0.5 kcal/mol). Of note the role
of BSSE corrections (as computed using the <a class="reference internal" href="../bsse/distance.html#distance-based-cp"><span class="std std-ref">Distance-Based CP</span></a> correction)
was also considered.</p>
<p>In looking at explicitly correlated CCSD(T) energies of water clusters,

the fragmentation method, more specifically GEBF14 uses <a class="reference internal" href="../algorithms/frag_methods/gebf.html#gebf14-fragmenation-method"><span class="std std-ref">GEBF14 Fragmentation Method</span></a> which is

explicitly correlated MP2/CBS results to within about 0.3 kcal/mol (errors
when GEBF was also applied to the SCF component of the energy were about
1 kcal/mol). The authors attributed the better performance of only applying
GEBF to the correlation energy to a better treatment of BSSE.</p>
<p>In looking at host/guest complexes, <span id="id8">Li <em>et al.</em><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id98" title="Wei Li, Mingzhou Duan, Kang Liao, Benkun Hong, Zhigang Ni, Jing Ma, and Shuhua Li.

often resulted in one fragment which contained all of, or most of, the
pseudoatoms (presumably because of ties in pseudoatom distances?). Regardless,
to avoid this, <span id="id9">Li <em>et al.</em><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id98" title="Wei Li, Mingzhou Duan, Kang Liao, Benkun Hong, Zhigang Ni, Jing Ma, and Shuhua Li.

GEBF19 was applied to 10
systems from the S30L database (TODO: cite). At the M06-2X/def2-TZVP level of
theory, GEBF19 was able to reproduce supersystem binding energies to better than
1 kcal/mol; however, more careful analysis showed that this was a result of
error cancellation.</p>
<p><span id="id10">Cheng <em>et al.</em><sup><a class="reference internal" href="../../bibliography/index.html#id100" title="Zheng Cheng, Dongbo Zhao, Jing Ma, Wei Li, and Shuhua Li.

end they introduced an approximation to the GEBF14 method by not embedding the
fragments. The resulting GEBF20 method was then used to combine the energies,
gradients, and dipole moments computed by a machine-learning model. GEBF20 was
then used to perform MD runs  for a series of alkanes.</p>

<p>We need to verify that all of the embedding methods are truly the same. In
particular I think some of the methods only do one iteration where others
iterate to consistency every time. Another variation is in how the charges

<p>As the above table shows, there are a number of different methods which have
been termed “GEBF”. We suspect that the authors of the GEBF method originally
felt that it was the energy equations which defined GEBF. This is supported by
the follow up studies which changed the fragmentation method still calling the
method GEBF.  However, the GEBF energy equation is nothing more than the
inclusion-exclusion principle (accounting for the self-interaction of the point

comparisons to both periodic supersystem calculations as well as experiment.
Results provided included optimized geometries, lattice energies, vibrational
frequency shifts, and Raman spectra. Most results were obtained with the M06-2X
functional and/or MP2. Generally speaking agreement between PBC-GEBF and the
supersystem or experiment were good.</p>
