tests/ghostfragment
###################

This directory's structure is meant to mirror ``src/ghostfragment``. Unit tests
are located in their mirrored positions (*e.g.*, the module defined in
``src/ghostfragment/single_atom.cpp`` is unit tested in
``tests/ghostfragment/single_atom.cpp``).

To facilitate unit testing note (all functions in the ``testing`` namespace):

- ``testing/water.hpp`` contains:

  - ``water(size_t n)`` which will generate a line of water molecules that is
    ``n`` waters long separated by 3 bohr.
  - ``water_fragmented_nuclei(size_t n)`` will take a cluster of ``n`` water
    molecules (generated by ``water(size_t)``) and fragment it into ``n``
    fragments such that there is one water molecule per fragment.
